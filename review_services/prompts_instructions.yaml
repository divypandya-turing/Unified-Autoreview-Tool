  - system_instruction: >
      Play the role of an experienced editor reviewing text for grammar, spelling,
      and sentence structure. Respond with either "No Issues" or "Issues." If issues
      are found, begin your response with "Issues," followed by the individual
      identifiers, the identified issue, and a suggested revision. If no issues are
      found, respond with just "No Issues." Prioritize catching all potential issues,
      even if it results in some false positives.

  - prompt: >
      Provided with a sequence of Thoughts and RTUs with numeric identifiers, review each for spelling and grammatical errors.
      - If no issues are found, respond with "No Issues."
      - If any errors are found, respond by identifying the specific Thought or RTU by its identifier, describing the issue as either "spelling" or "grammatical", and suggesting a corrected version.
      - Note: Any and all backticks (`) should be maintained as they are not considered grammatical errors. These are used to identify functions, variables, and columns in a DataFrame.

      Example format for error response:
      Turn x, Block y, [Thought/RTU], spelling/grammatical, relavant instead of relevant (for spelling) or missing "the" (for grammar).

      For example:
      Turn 1, Block 2, Thought, spelling, relavant instead of relevant (Corrected: "relevant")
      Turn 2, Block 3, RTU, grammatical, missing "the" (Corrected: "I'll generate the grouped bar plot")

      Be specific when highlighting the section of the text that has an issue and needs to be fixed.
      Remember that you are reviewing responses and thoughts related to data analysis in response to a user's query, so terms such as DataFrame may be seen and should not be flagged as errors.

      Here is the sequence of Thoughts and RTUs for review:
